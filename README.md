### The AI-Powered, Enterprise-Grade, Human-Centric, Quantum-Adjacent Productivity Orchestration Suite™

## What Is ClientTimer²?

ClientTimer² is...

...a **temporal orchestration engine**.

...a **workload telemetry surface**.

...a **frictionless, AI-ready, context-aware productivity substrate** that just so happens to look like a simple window full of timers.

In a world drowning in tabs, dashboards, KPIs, and “quick syncs,” ClientTimer² dares to ask a radical question: "**What if you just… had a button that said “Start” and another one that said “Stop”?**"

And then it **answers that question at scale**.

---

## Core Value Proposition (a.k.a. What It Actually Does)

- **Hyper-minimalist UI**  
  A single window. Rows. Start/Stop buttons. Group headers. No “spaces,” “boards,” or “mission canvases.” Just **time**, marching forward like a relentless soldier trekking through a storm.

- **AI-Inspired, Human-Executed Intelligence**  
  There is currently no AI model running inside ClientTimer². However, we here at ClientTimer² Studios believe that this application still absolutely warrants the inclusion of the term "AI", and we believe you will too. The moment you find yourself dragging a client under a separator for the first time,  you WILL hear yourself say out loud "Wow. This is extremely intelligent. And since it isn't a biological organism, it simply MUST be referred to as Artificial Intelligence." Well said, my friend. Well said indeed.

- **Client-Centric Time Tracking**  
  - Arbitrary number of clients (a.k.a. temporal entities).  
  - Group them into separators (“Frequent Fliers”, “Verizon”, “The One Project You’re Avoiding”).  
  - View aggregate time per group like a beautiful, unavoidable mirror into your own soul.

- **One-Click Temporal Exclusivity**  
  - Click **Start** -> that timer starts, all others stop.  
  - Hold **Shift + Start** → add another running timer without stopping others.  
  - Elegance taken to its natural conclusion. **Single-threaded discipline or multi-task chaos: your choice, in one button.**

- **Live, Honest, Emotional Damage Dashboards**  
  - Per-client running time.  
  - Per-group totals.  
  - Counts of how many tasks live under each group.  
  - The exact thing you don’t want to see at the end of the day, shown to you anyway... and beautifully.

- **Theme Engine for Corporate Vibes**  
  Hand-crafted aesthetic profiles to help you not just watch, but FEEL your life ticking by one second at a time.

## Why ClientTimer² Instead of Yet Another SaaS Dashboard?

Because:

- It runs \~**locally**\~
- It stores everything in **plain JSON**.
- It does **exactly one thing** and refuses to apologize for it.
- There is **no signup**, **no cloud**, **no telemetry**, and **no subscription**.
- No one will ever email you a “We’ve redesigned the dashboard!” announcement.

ClientTimer² is productivity software for people who:

- Are psychologically threatened by the word "synergy" in a corporate tool...
- But still need to know how long they’ve been on hold with a carrier.

## Feature Deep Dive

### UI Lock / Unlock

ClientTimer² ships with an **explicit UI lock**:

- **Locked**:  
  - You cannot drag or reorder rows.  
  - Accidental re-arrangement during caffeine incidents is prevented.  
  - The app becomes a stoic, immovable ledger of your decisions.

- **Unlocked**:  
  - Drag clients, drag groups, rearrange your life.  
  - Drag entire **collapsed groups** as a single movable chunk.  
  - Rebuild your workflow hierarchy as many times as your anxiety demands.

Everything is visualized with a tiny lock icon that you *will* grow attached to emotionally.

### Grouping & Collapsing

- Create **groups** (separators) like:
  - `Frequent Fliers`
  - `Verizon`
  - `Random Fires`

- Collapse them to hide child timers when you’re not emotionally prepared to see them.

- Each group:
  - Shows **child count**: `(5)`
  - Shows **aggregate time**: `03:27:41`
  - Bold + highlight when any child is running.

This creates a hierarchical temporal ontology of your job.

---

### Keyboard-Aware Behavior

- **Shift** key flips the semantics:
  - `Start` → `Add` (non-exclusive start)
  - `-5 / +5` → `-1 / +1`
  - `X` → `0` (reset instead of delete)

- Shift state is tracked at the **UI level**, so the whole interface subtly transforms from "I am logging time like a good little drone" to "I am surgically editing the fabric of reality in one-minute increments."

---

### Backups & Safety

ClientTimer² fears data loss significantly more than you do:

- Autosaves your times every few seconds while active.
- Maintains **rotating JSON backups** in a dedicated folder:
  - Configurable **backup frequency (min)**  
  - Configurable **max number of backups**
- You can open the save folder with one click via Settings, just in case you want to:
  - Copy things elsewhere
  - Travel back to a save from 30 minutes ago when you hadn't spent 29 minutes on a call that went nowhere
  - Or just stare at raw JSON and feel something

---

### Daily Auto-Reset (Toggleable)

Want a fresh slate every day?

- Enable **Daily Reset** in Settings.
- Choose any time (e.g., `00:00` or `03:00`).
- Once that time hits, once per calendar day:
  - All timers stop.
  - All values reset to `00:00:00`.
  - You begin again, baptized in chronometric fire.
  - If this time is passed while the app isn't open, don't fear - it'll still reset. The corporate clock is working even when you're not.

---

### Theme & Font Customization

In the **Appearance** tab:

- Choose size presets: `Microscopic` → `Gargantuan`
- Choose theme: from neutral defaults to “my employer is a telecom and I am leaning into it.”
- Choose font:  
  - `Calibri`, `Consolas`, `Segoe UI`, `Comic Sans MS` (yes, it’s there, and no, we’re not judging)
- Choose label alignment: `Left`, `Center`, or `Right`.

What kind of themes will you find? Only everything you could ever possibly want, and likely a fair bit more:

- *Cupertino Light* - "I don't purchase electronics that don't have a fruit logo on them."
- *Galaxy Dark* - "I'm not like the normies. I'm special and I'm different."
- *A Way* - "When I am actually at my desk, I want my monitor to look like a bee got trapped in it."
- *Black Herizons* - "Brutalistic reds and blacks that will make you feel like the resident cool guy."
- *Cimply Premier* - "What if we took a bunch of muted blue client portals and smashed them together, and it was still boring?"
- *Gray Until Further Notice* - "Gray is the only serious color and I won't let joy prevent that truth."
- *ICOMM Blues* - "Company pride with just a touch of TMA."
- *Manila Memories* - "Nostalgia for simpler times."
- *Park In The Forest* - "It isn't redundant, it's just very serene and green."
- *T-Magentle* - "Like being verbally abused by the concept of fuchsia."

All delightfully demonstrated in a live preview, so you don't even have to close the app to get a taste of what you could have if you were only bold enough to commit to your favorite color. 

**Productivity isn’t just about time. It’s about the **vibe** of the window you’re ignoring.**
